1.
I should make GameState classes very modular. For example, I can create separate
objects for checking the answers, or sending certain screens to the clients,
such that I can re-use code for differnt GameState classes that are partially
similar!
For this I can use some pattern where the constructor creates these modules,
and that the constructors of these modules take a reference to the respective
(private) data members as arguments.

Want to make a script that automatically checks all the different types of
question classes, and creates a file that exports all of these, and also has
a Map which has their names as strings as keys, and maps them to the actual
class, such that I can call the right constructor in that manner.
