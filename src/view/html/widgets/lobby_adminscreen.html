    <p>Were you working in groups (where a single player was logged in for the whole group), but do you now want to continue with individual players?
       Then press the button shown below. It will remove and disconnect all players, but save their names and scores in the table below. Then, for
       players that just log in, you can quickly put them into their former group to give them the amount of points their group had.

    <button id="remove_all_players_btn">REMOVE ALL PLAYERS!</button>
